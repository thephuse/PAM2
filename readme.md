Phuse Activity Monitor (PAM) v.2.0
====================================

Setup: 
- npm install
- node app.js
- open at localhost/1234

Things: 
- Node.js with Express.js in the back
- Backbone.js in the front
- Use express routing to map harvest api
- consume data from said routes in Backbone 

##It's a big mess and there are problems but I KNOW
This is my first backbone thing and all the code is in one place cause node and it's not very DRY. 

##To do
- huge refactor (frontend first, backend isn't *that* bad)
- sort out the whole billable/nonbillable nightmare (must make one API call for each >_<_)
- add total stats for whole team
